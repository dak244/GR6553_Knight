This project is looking at conditions before and uring Hurricane Harveys landfall on August 25th, 2017. 

The 3-day sea surface salinity average from the SMOS was found from https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/SMOS/3day/2017/catalog.html. Using the 3-day period where Harvey made landfall and the 3-day period before that. 

The sounding data is from the University of Wyoming sounding archive. Using the day before landfall at 00Z and 12Z of August 25th, 2017 and one just before landfall at August 26th at 00Z.

GFS half degree analysis data from the THREDDS server was used. The plots use the MSLP, the 925mb U and V wind components with the relative humidity. The data is from: https://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/casestudies/harvey/model/gfs_ana/catalog.html

Lastly the radar data was from the THREDDS server for the times before landfall. Every scan from about August 26th 00Z to 02Z was downloaded and used. The data is from: https://tds-nexrad.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/nexrad/level2/S3/2017/08/26/KCRP/catalog.html

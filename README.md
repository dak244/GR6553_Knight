This project is looking at conditions before and uring Hurricane Harveys landfall on August 25th, 2017. 
The 3-day sea surface salinity average from the SMOS was found from https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/SMOS/3day/2017/catalog.html.
Using the 3-day period where Harvey made landfall and the 3-day period befor that. The sounding data is from the University of Wyoming 
sounding archive. Using the day before landfall and one just before landfall. GFS half degree analysis data from the THREDDS server was
used. The plots use the MSLP, the 925mb u and v winds with the relative humidity. Lastly the radar data was from the THREDDS server for
the times before landfall.
